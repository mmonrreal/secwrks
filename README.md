Search for longest word
Assumptions for the .txt file are:
      English Language words
      non- alphabetical entries are not considered words
      entries are fed in a column and not space seperated
      Consideration of more than one word being of equal length needs to be considered but I did not have enough time to get that scenario working
      Scenarios taken into accoutn: single alphabetical character without return key
                                  : any feed containing non alphabetical characters are not considered words
                                  : empty lines have been 'thrown away'
Assumed wanted to see scripting and not solely python structure such as def

How to run:  python word_scramble.py
